Explain Algorith development.
An algorithm is a step by step description of method to solve a problem. Its is an effective procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.Algorithm maintains sequences of computer instructions required to solve a problem in such a way that if the instructions are executed in the specified sequence, the desired result is obtained.
Explain Sequence.
Sequence means that each step or process in the alogorithm is executed in the specified order. Each process must be the proper otherwise the algorithm will fail. A previous step must be executed before any other next steps.
